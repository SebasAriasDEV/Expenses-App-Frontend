# Flutter iBudget App

This is the front-end part of my personal full-stack project named iBudget app. This app is developed in **Flutter**, using **Provider** as state management.

This app is intended for people who need to manage their personal finances on a weekly/monthly basis. Users can:

- Create and manage their monthly budgets
- Add and manage transactions (income and expenses)
- See a summary of their net movements
- Create multiple accounts (debit and credit)
- See the report in multiple currencies

Back-end of the project can be found here [iBudget Backend](https://github.com/SebasAriasDEV/Expenses-App-Backend).
